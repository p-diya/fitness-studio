# Fitness Studio

This fitness studio website was developed as a collaborative academic group project. It offers a comprehensive set of features to facilitate user management, class enrollment, and an admin dashboard for managing customers, classes, and payments. 

I played a key role in designing and implementing various aspects of the website. Specifically, I was responsible for designing and developing the homepage, login and signup functionalities for user authentication, and the admin dashboard.
